/*
Consider an application that manages different types of animals, 
such as dogs, cats, and birds. Each animal can eat, sleep, make 
sounds, etc., but they each do so in different ways.


This is polymorphism, since each animal has access to a common behavioral interface.
ie they can do the same things but they can be implemented in different ways.
