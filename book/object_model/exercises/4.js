/*
Consider an application that manages a collection of living things, 
including plants and animals. Plants include trees and flowers, 
while animals include mammals and birds.

This sounds more like Inheritance, since more specific types of objects will inherit general
behavior from a more general object / class. In this case, trees and flowers inherit from plants
and mammals and birds inherit from animals.
