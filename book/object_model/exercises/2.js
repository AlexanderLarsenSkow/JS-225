/*
Consider an application that uses and manipulates objects 
that represent automobiles. Each automobile has a make, 
model, year, and methods that provide the ability to start, 
drive, and park the vehicle. All automobiles share the same 
set of methods, but the make, model, and year will vary between automobiles.

This is an example of Encapsulation, since every object encapsulates its own behavior
and state. Each object's state is different, yet the behavior that each object receives from the
constructor is the more or less the same.
