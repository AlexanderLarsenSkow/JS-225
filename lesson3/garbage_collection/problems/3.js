/*
Yes, JavaScript is a Garbage Collection Language, which means that when an object or primitive value
no longer has any references, the memory allocated for that object/ value will be freed up / released
so it can be used for other things.

That is the essence of Garbage collection, though it can have problems when references are kept
throughout the program.
